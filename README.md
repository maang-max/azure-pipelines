# azure-pipelines
Here's a sample YAML pipeline file that includes stages for creating an Azure Container Registry (ACR), building the application, testing, containerization, deployment to Kubernetes, and verification
Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (<Azure Subscription>, <ACR Name>, <Resource Group Name>, <Image Name>, <Path to Dockerfile>, <Azure Subscription Endpoint>, <Kubernetes Cluster Name>, <Path to Kubernetes Deployment YAML>) with the actual values relevant to your Azure environment and application. Additionally, you may need to configure authentication and authorization for the Azure resources and services used in the pipeline.

Make sure to adapt the pipeline to your specific application and infrastructure requirements.
